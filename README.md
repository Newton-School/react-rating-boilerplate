# Rate me!

We have a predefined <code>Star</code> component, which we are displaying one in App.js
inside the #rating-holder div.

Above that div implement an inout of type number and id="rating-input",
whose default value is 1.

This is as the name indicates the number of stars being displayed inside #rating-holder div.

Also user should not be able increase the value of rating-input below 1 or above 5.

That is 1 is the minimum amount of Star and 5 is maximum that can be displayed.
